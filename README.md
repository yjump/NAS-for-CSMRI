Repo for "Neural Architecture Search for Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction".  

The original project was built on https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI and https://github.com/quark0/darts . 

The current code base was based on pytorch version is pytorch=0.4.1=py36_cuda8.0.61_cudnn7.1.2_1 with torchvision=0.2.1=py36_0 without maintenance to adapt new pytorch version.

This project is for research purpose and not approved for clinical use.
