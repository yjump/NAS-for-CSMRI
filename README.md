Repo for "Neural Architecture Search for Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction".  

Update: 2021.06.12:

Sorry for the delay but I am still not authorized to make codes public due to the orresponding auther and our team member's extensive work (under review) based on this project. Here I recommend to follow (my thanks to) https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI and https://github.com/quark0/darts to re-implement my results based on which I built this project. Feel free to email the cor-responding author if any problems.

Thanks a lot for your attention. The inference model and weights will be released after our extensive work.


We will release our code, once our article is publised. Our article is to be appear in Computerized Medical Imaging And Graphics, or refer to arxiv version:
